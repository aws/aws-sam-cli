# These are some hard packages to build. Using them here helps us verify that building works on various platforms

# NOTE: Fixing to <1.20.3 as numpy1.20.3 started to use a new wheel naming convention (PEP 600)
numpy<1.20.3; python_version < '3.10'
numpy==1.26.4; python_version >= '3.10'
# `cryptography` has a dependency on `pycparser` which, for some reason doesn't build inside a Docker container.
