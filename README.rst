SAM CLI (Beta)
==============

|Build Status| |Apache-2.0| |Contributers| |GitHub-release| |PyPI version|

`Join the SAM developers channel (#samdev) on
Slack <https://awssamopensource.splashthat.com/>`__ to collaborate with
fellow community members and the AWS SAM team.

``sam`` is the AWS CLI tool for managing Serverless applications
written with `AWS Serverless Application Model
(SAM) <https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model>`__. SAM
CLI can be used to test functions locally, start a local API Gateway
from a SAM template, validate a SAM template, fetch logs, generate sample payloads
for various event sources, and generate a SAM project in your favorite
Lambda Runtime.

Installation
------------

Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Docker
- Python2.7 or Python3.6

Running Serverless projects and functions locally with SAM CLI requires
Docker to be installed and running. SAM CLI will use the ``DOCKER_HOST``
environment variable to contact the docker daemon.

-  **macOS**: `Docker for
   Mac <https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-mac>`__
-  **Windows**: `Docker
   For Windows (create an account & follow through to download from the Docker Store) <https://www.docker.com/docker-windows>`__
-  **Linux**: Check your distro’s package manager (e.g. yum install docker)

**Note for macOS and Windows users**: SAM CLI requires that the project directory
(or any parent directory) is listed in `Docker file sharing options <https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/osxfs/>`__.

Verify that docker is working, and that you can run docker commands from
the CLI (e.g. `docker ps`). You do not need to install/fetch/pull any
containers – SAM CLI will do it automatically as required.

Windows, Linux, macOS with PIP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Verify Python Version is 2.7 or 3.6.

.. code:: bash

    $ python --version

The easiest way to install ``sam`` is to use
`PIP <https://pypi.org/>`__.

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install --user aws-sam-cli

**Adjust your PATH** to include Python scripts installed under User's directory.

**NOTE**: As explained in the `Python Developer's Guide <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0370/#specification>`__, the User's directory where the scripts are installed is ``~/.local/bin`` for Unix/Mac and ``%APPDATA%\Python\Scripts`` for Windows.

The Python command can help to detect the correct path. However, in Unix/Mac systems the command ``python -m site --user-base`` typically print ``~/.local`` path, so that you'll need to add ``/bin`` to obtain the script path, while in Windows systems the command ``py -m site --user-site`` typically print ``%APPDATA%\Roaming\Python<VERSION>\site-packages``, so you'll need to remove the last ``\site-packages`` folder and replace it with the ``\Scripts`` one.

.. code:: bash

    # Find your Python User Base path (where Python --user will install packages/scripts)
    $ USER_BASE_PATH=$(python -m site --user-base)

    # Update your preferred shell configuration
    ## Standard bash --> ~/.bash_profile
    ## ZSH           --> ~/.zshrc
    $ export PATH=$PATH:$USER_BASE_PATH/bin

Restart or Open up a new terminal and verify that the installation worked:

.. code:: bash

   # Restart current shell
   $ exec "$SHELL"
   $ sam --version

Upgrading
~~~~~~~~~~

``sam`` can be upgraded via pip:

.. code:: bash

   $ pip install --user --upgrade aws-sam-cli

Previous CLI Versions must be uninstalled first (0.2.11 or below) and then follow the `Installation <#windows-linux-macos-with-pip>`__ steps above:

.. code:: bash

   $ npm uninstall -g aws-sam-local

Usage
-----

**Create a sample app with sam init command**: ``sam init`` or ``sam init --runtime <favourite-runtime>``

``sam`` requires a SAM template in order to know how to invoke your
function locally, and it’s also true for spawning API Gateway locally -
If no template is specified ``template.yaml`` will be used instead.

Alternatively, you can find other sample SAM Templates by visiting `SAM <https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model>`__ official repository.

Invoke functions locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. figure:: media/sam-invoke.gif
   :alt: SAM CLI Invoke Sample

   SAM CLI Invoke Sample

You can invoke your function locally by passing its **SAM logical ID**
and an event file. Alternatively, ``sam local invoke`` accepts stdin as
an event too.

.. code:: yaml

   Resources:
     Ratings:  # <-- Logical ID
       Type: 'AWS::Serverless::Function'
     ...

**Syntax**

.. code:: bash

   # Invoking function with event file
   $ sam local invoke "Ratings" -e event.json

   # Invoking function with event via stdin
   $ echo '{"message": "Hey, are you there?" }' | sam local invoke "Ratings"

   # For more options
   $ sam local invoke --help


Run automated tests for your Lambda functions locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You can use the ``sam local invoke`` command to manually test your code 
by running Lambda function locally. With SAM CLI, you can easily
author automated integration tests by
first running tests against local Lambda functions before deploying to the
cloud. The ``sam local start-lambda`` command starts a local
endpoint that emulates the AWS Lambda service’s invoke endpoint, and you
can invoke it from your automated tests. Because this endpoint emulates
the Lambda service's invoke endpoint, you can write tests once and run
them (without any modifications) against the local Lambda function or
against a deployed Lambda function. You can also run the same tests
against a deployed SAM stack in your CI/CD pipeline.

Here is how this works:

**1. Start the Local Lambda Endpoint** 

Start the local Lambda endpoint by running the following command in the directory that contains your AWS
SAM template:

.. code:: bash

   sam local start-lambda

This command starts a local endpoint at http://127.0.0.1:3001 that
emulates the AWS Lambda service, and you can run your automated tests
against this local Lambda endpoint. When you send an invoke to this
endpoint using the AWS CLI or SDK, it will locally execute the Lambda
function specified in the request and return a response.

**2. Run integration test against local Lambda endpoint** 

In your integration test, you can use AWS SDK to invoke your Lambda function
with test data, wait for response, and assert that the response what you
expect. To run the integration test locally, you should configure AWS
SDK to send Lambda Invoke API call to local Lambda endpoint started in
previous step.

Here is an Python example (AWS SDK for other languages have similar
configurations):

.. code:: python

   import boto3
   import botocore
   
   # Set "running_locally" flag if you are running the integration test locally
   running_locally = True
   
   if running_locally:

       # Create Lambda SDK client to connect to appropriate Lambda endpoint
       lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda',
           region_name="us-west-2",
           endpoint_url="http://127.0.0.1:3001",
           use_ssl=False,
           verify=False,
           config=botocore.client.Config(
               signature_version=botocore.UNSIGNED,
               read_timeout=0,
               retries={'max_attempts': 0},
           )
       )
   else:
       lambda_client = boto3.client('lambda')
                                           

   # Invoke your Lambda function as you normally usually do. The function will run 
   # locally if it is configured to do so
   response = lambda_client.invoke(FunctionName="HelloWorldFunction")

   # Verify the response 
   assert response == "Hello World"

This code can run without modifications against a Lambda function which
is deployed. To do so, set the ``running_locally`` flag to ``False`` .
This will setup AWS SDK to connect to AWS Lambda service on the cloud.

Connecting to docker network
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ``sam local invoke`` and ``sam local start-api`` support connecting
the create lambda docker containers to an existing docker network.

To connect the containers to an existing docker network, you can use the
``--docker-network`` command-line argument or the ``SAM_DOCKER_NETWORK``
environment variable along with the name or id of the docker network you
wish to connect to.

.. code:: bash

   # Invoke a function locally and connect to a docker network
   $ sam local invoke --docker-network my-custom-network <function logical id>

   # Start local API Gateway and connect all containers to a docker network
   $ sam local start-api --docker-network b91847306671 -d 5858


Generate sample event source payloads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To make local development and testing of Lambda functions easier, you
can generate mock/sample event payloads for the following services:

-  S3
-  Kinesis Streams
-  DynamoDB
-  Cloudwatch Scheduled Event
-  API Gateway
-  SNS

**Syntax**

.. code:: bash

   $ sam local generate-event <service>

Also, you can invoke an individual lambda function locally from a sample
event payload - Here’s an example using S3:

.. code:: bash

   $ sam local generate-event s3 --bucket <bucket> --key <key> | sam local invoke <function logical id>

For more options, see ``sam local generate-event --help``.

Run API Gateway locally
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``sam local start-api`` spawns a local API Gateway to test HTTP
request/response functionality. Features hot-reloading to allow you to
quickly develop, and iterate over your functions.

.. figure:: media/sam-start-api.gif
   :alt: SAM CLI Start API

   SAM CLI Start API

**Syntax**

.. code:: bash

   $ sam local start-api

``sam`` will automatically find any functions within your SAM
template that have ``Api`` event sources defined, and mount them at the
defined HTTP paths.

In the example below, the ``Ratings`` function would mount
``ratings.py:handler()`` at ``/ratings`` for ``GET`` requests.

.. code:: yaml

   Ratings:
     Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
     Properties:
       Handler: ratings.handler
       Runtime: python3.6
       Events:
         Api:
           Type: Api
           Properties:
             Path: /ratings
             Method: get

By default, SAM uses `Proxy
Integration <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html>`__
and expects the response from your Lambda function to include one or
more of the following: ``statusCode``, ``headers`` and/or ``body``.

For example:

.. code:: javascript

   // Example of a Proxy Integration response
   exports.handler = (event, context, callback) => {
       callback(null, {
           statusCode: 200,
           headers: { "x-custom-header" : "my custom header value" },
           body: "hello world"
       });
   }

For examples in other AWS Lambda languages, see `this
page <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html>`__.

If your function does not return a valid `Proxy
Integration <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html>`__
response then you will get a HTTP 500 (Internal Server Error) when
accessing your function. SAM CLI will also print the following error log
message to help you diagnose the problem:

::

   ERROR: Function ExampleFunction returned an invalid response (must include one of: body, headers or statusCode in the response object)

Debugging Applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ``sam local invoke`` and ``sam local start-api`` support local
debugging of your functions.

To run SAM Local with debugging support enabled, just specify
``--debug-port`` or ``-d`` on the command line.

.. code:: bash

   # Invoke a function locally in debug mode on port 5858
   $ sam local invoke -d 5858 <function logical id>

   # Start local API Gateway in debug mode on port 5858
   $ sam local start-api -d 5858

Note: If using ``sam local start-api``, the local API Gateway will
expose all of your Lambda functions but, since you can specify a single
debug port, you can only debug one function at a time. You will need to
hit your API before SAM CLI binds to the port allowing the debugger to
connect.

Here is an example showing how to debug a NodeJS function with Microsoft
Visual Studio Code:

.. figure:: media/sam-debug.gif
   :alt: SAM Local debugging example

   SAM Local debugging example

In order to setup Visual Studio Code for debugging with AWS SAM CLI, use
the following launch configuration:

.. code:: json

   {
       "version": "0.2.0",
       "configurations": [
           {
               "name": "Attach to SAM CLI",
               "type": "node",
               "request": "attach",
               "address": "localhost",
               "port": 5858,
               "localRoot": "${workspaceRoot}",
               "remoteRoot": "/var/task",
               "protocol": "legacy"
           }
       ]
   }

Note: Node.js versions **below** 7 (e.g. Node.js 4.3 and Node.js 6.10)
use the ``legacy`` protocol, while Node.js versions including and above
7 (e.g. Node.js 8.10) use the ``inspector`` protocol. Be sure to specify
the corresponding protocol in the ``protocol`` entry of your launch
configuration.

Debugging Python functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Unlike Node.JS and Java, Python requires you to enable remote debugging
in your Lambda function code. If you enable debugging with
``--debug-port`` or ``-d`` for a function that uses one of the Python
runtimes, SAM CLI will just map through that port from your host machine
through to the Lambda runtime container. You will need to enable remote
debugging in your function code. To do this, use a python package such
as `remote-pdb <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/remote-pdb>`__. When
configuring the host the debugger listens on in your code, make sure to
use ``0.0.0.0`` not ``127.0.0.1`` to allow Docker to map through the
port to your host machine.

   Please note, due to a `open
   bug <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/71>`__ with
   Visual Studio Code, you may get a
   ``Debug adapter process has terminated unexpectedly`` error when
   attempting to debug Python applications with this IDE. Please track
   the `GitHub
   issue <https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-python/issues/71>`__ for
   updates.

Debugging Golang functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Golang function debugging is slightly different when compared to Node.JS,
Java, and Python. We require `delve <https://github.com/derekparker/delve>`__
as the debugger, and wrap your function with it at runtime. The debugger
is run in headless mode, listening on the debug port.

When debugging, you must compile your function in debug mode:

`GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -gcflags='-N -l' -o <output path> <path to code directory>

You must compile `delve` to run in the container and provide its local path
via the `--debugger-path` argument. Build delve locally as follows:

`GOARCH=amd64 GOOS=linux go build -o <delve folder path>/dlv github.com/derekparker/delve/cmd/dlv`

NOTE: The output path needs to end in `/dlv`. The docker container will expect the dlv binary to be in the <delve folder path>
and will cause mounting issue otherwise.

Then invoke `sam` similar to the following:

`sam local start-api -d 5986 --debugger-path <delve folder path>`

NOTE: The `--debugger-path` is the path to the directory that contains the `dlv` binary compiled from the above.

The following is an example launch configuration for Visual Studio Code to
attach to a debug session.

.. code:: json

  {
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
    {
        "name": "Connect to Lambda container",
        "type": "go",
        "request": "launch",
        "mode": "remote",
        "remotePath": "",
        "port": <debug port>,
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}",
        "env": {},
        "args": [],
      },
    ]
  }


Passing Additional Runtime Debug Arguments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To pass additional runtime arguments when debugging your function, use
the environment variable ``DEBUGGER_ARGS``. This will pass a string
of arguments directly into the run command SAM CLI uses to start your
function.

For example, if you want to load a debugger like iKPdb at runtime of
your Python function, you could pass the following as
``DEBUGGER_ARGS``:
``-m ikpdb --ikpdb-port=5858 --ikpdb-working-directory=/var/task/ --ikpdb-client-working-directory=/myApp --ikpdb-address=0.0.0.0``.
This would load iKPdb at runtime with the other arguments you’ve
specified. In this case, your full SAM CLI command would be:

.. code:: bash

   $ DEBUGGER_ARGS="-m ikpdb --ikpdb-port=5858 --ikpdb-working-directory=/var/task/ --ikpdb-client-working-directory=/myApp --ikpdb-address=0.0.0.0" echo {} | sam local invoke -d 5858 myFunction

You may pass debugger arguments to functions of all runtimes.

To simplify troubleshooting, we added a new command called ``sam logs``
to SAM CLI. ``sam logs`` lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda
function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the
terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly
find the bug. Note: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not
just the ones you deploy using SAM.

Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called ``sam logs``. 
``sam logs`` lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda
function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the
terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly
find the bug. 

Note: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not
just the ones you deploy using SAM.

**Basic Usage: Using CloudFormation Stack** 

When your function is a part
of a CloudFormation stack, you can fetch logs using the function's
LogicalID:

.. code:: bash

   sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack

**Basic Usage: Using Lambda Function name** 

Or, you can fetch logs using the function's name

.. code:: bash

   sam logs -n mystack-HelloWorldFunction-1FJ8PD

**Tail Logs** 

Add ``--tail`` option to wait for new logs and see them as
they arrive. This is very handy during deployment or when
troubleshooting a production issue.

.. code:: bash

   sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --tail

**View logs for specific time range** 
You can view logs for specific time range using the ``-s`` and ``-e`` options

.. code:: bash

   sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack -s '10min ago' -e '2min ago'

**Filter Logs** 

Use the ``--filter`` option to quickly find logs that
match terms, phrases or values in your log events

.. code:: bash

   sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name mystack --filter "error"

In the output, SAM CLI will underline all occurrences of the word
“error” so you can easily locate the filter keyword within the log
output.

**Error Highlighting** 

When your Lambda function crashes or times out,
SAM CLI will highlight the timeout message in red. This will help you
easily locate specific executions that are timing out within a giant
stream of log output.

   :alt: SAM CLI Logs Error Highlighting


**JSON pretty printing** 

If your log messages print JSON strings, SAM
CLI will automatically pretty print the JSON to help you visually parse
and understand the JSON.

.. figure:: https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22755571/42301064-50c6cffa-7fc8-11e8-8f31-04ef117a9c5a.png
   :alt: SAM CLI Logs JSON Pretty Print

Validate SAM templates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Validate your templates with ``$ sam validate``. Currently this command
will validate that the template provided is valid JSON / YAML. As with
most SAM CLI commands, it will look for a ``template.[yaml|yml]`` file
in your current working directory by default. You can specify a
different template file/location with the ``-t`` or ``--template``
option.

**Syntax**

.. code:: bash

   $ sam validate
   <path-to-file>/template.yml is a valid SAM Template

Note: The validate command requires AWS credentials to be configured. See `IAM Credentials <#iam-credentials>`__.

Package and Deploy to Lambda
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have developed and tested your Serverless application locally,
you can deploy to Lambda using ``sam package`` and ``sam deploy``
command.

``sam package`` command will zip your code artifacts, upload to S3
and produce a SAM file that is ready to be deployed to Lambda using AWS
CloudFormation.

``sam deploy`` command will deploy the packaged SAM template
to CloudFormation.

Both ``sam package`` and ``sam deploy`` are identical
to their AWS CLI equivalents commands
`aws cloudformation package <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/package.html>`__
and
`aws cloudformation deploy <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/deploy/index.html>`__
respectively - Please consult the AWS CLI command documentation for usage.

Example:

.. code:: bash

   # Package SAM template
   $ sam package --template-file sam.yaml --s3-bucket mybucket --output-template-file packaged.yaml

   # Deploy packaged SAM template
   $ sam deploy --template-file ./packaged.yaml --stack-name mystack --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM

Advanced
--------

Compiled Languages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Java**

To use SAM CLI with compiled languages, such as Java that require a
packaged artifact (e.g. a JAR, or ZIP), you can specify the location of
the artifact with the ``AWS::Serverless::Function`` ``CodeUri`` property
in your SAM template.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
   Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

   Resources:
     ExampleJavaFunction:
       Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
       Properties:
         Handler: com.example.HelloWorldHandler
         CodeUri: ./target/HelloWorld-1.0.jar
         Runtime: java8

You should then build your JAR file using your normal build process.
Please note that JAR files used with AWS Lambda should be a shaded JAR
file (or uber jar) containing all of the function dependencies.

.. code:: bash

   // Build the JAR file
   $ mvn package shade:shade

   // Invoke with SAM Local
   $ echo '{ "some": "input" }' | sam local invoke

   // Or start local API Gateway simulator
   $ sam local start-api


**.NET Core**

To use SAM Local with compiled languages, such as .NET Core that require a packaged artifact (e.g. a ZIP), you can specify the location of the artifact with the ``AWS::Serverless::Function`` ``CodeUri`` property in your SAM template.

For example:

.. code:: yaml

   AWSTemplateFormatVersion: 2010-09-09
   Transform: AWS::Serverless-2016-10-31

   Resources:
     ExampleDotNetFunction:
       Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
       Properties:
         Handler: HelloWorld::HelloWorld.Function::Handler
         CodeUri: ./artifacts/HelloWorld.zip
         Runtime: dotnetcore2.0

You should then build your ZIP file using your normal build process.

You can generate a .NET Core example by using the ``sam init --runtime dotnetcore`` command.

SAM CLI will invoke functions with your locally configured IAM
credentials.

As with the AWS CLI and SDKs, SAM CLI will look for credentials in the
following order:

1. Environment Variables (``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID``,
   ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``).
2. The AWS credentials file (located at ``~/.aws/credentials`` on Linux,
   macOS, or Unix, or at ``C:\Users\USERNAME \.aws\credentials`` on
   Windows).
3. Instance profile credentials (if running on Amazon EC2 with an
   assigned instance role).

In order to test API Gateway with a non-default profile from your AWS
credentials file append ``--profile <profile name>`` to the
``start-api`` command:

.. code:: bash

   // Test API Gateway locally with a credential profile.
   $ sam local start-api --profile some_profile

See this `Configuring the AWS
CLI <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html#config-settings-and-precedence>`__
for more details.

Lambda Environment Variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If your Lambda function uses environment variables, you can provide
values for them will passed to the Docker container. Here is how you
would do it:

For example, consider the SAM template snippet:

.. code:: yaml


   Resources:
     MyFunction1:
       Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
       Properties:
         Handler: index.handler
         Runtime: nodejs4.3
         Environment:
           Variables:
             TABLE_NAME: prodtable
             BUCKET_NAME: prodbucket

     MyFunction2:
       Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
       Properties:
         Handler: app.handler
         Runtime: nodejs4.3
         Environment:
           Variables:
             STAGE: prod
             TABLE_NAME: prodtable


Environment Variable file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use ``--env-vars`` argument of ``invoke`` or ``start-api`` commands to
provide a JSON file that contains values for environment variables
defined in your function. The file should be structured as follows:

.. code:: json

   {
     "MyFunction1": {
       "TABLE_NAME": "localtable",
       "BUCKET_NAME": "testBucket"
     },
     "MyFunction2": {
       "TABLE_NAME": "localtable",
       "STAGE": "dev"
     },
   }

.. code:: bash

   $ sam local start-api --env-vars env.json


Shell environment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Variables defined in your Shell’s environment will be passed to the
Docker container, if they map to a Variable in your Lambda function.
Shell variables are globally applicable to functions ie. If two
functions have a variable called ``TABLE_NAME``, then the value for
``TABLE_NAME`` provided through Shell’s environment will be availabe to
both functions.

Following command will make value of ``mytable`` available to both
``MyFunction1`` and ``MyFunction2``

.. code:: bash

   $ TABLE_NAME=mytable sam local start-api

Combination of Shell and Environment Variable file
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For greater control, you can use a combination shell variables and
external environment variable file. If a variable is defined in both
places, the one from the file will override the shell. Here is the order
of priority, highest to lowest. Higher priority ones will override the
lower.

1. Environment Variable file
2. Shell’s environment
3. Hard-coded values from the template

Identifying local execution from Lambda function code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When your Lambda function is invoked using SAM CLI, it sets an
environment variable ``AWS_SAM_LOCAL=true`` in the Docker container.
Your Lambda function can use this property to enable or disable
functionality that would not make sense in local development. For
example: Disable emitting metrics to CloudWatch (or) Enable verbose
logging etc.

Static Assets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Often, it’s useful to serve up static assets (e.g CSS/HTML/Javascript
etc) when developing a Serverless application. On AWS, this would
normally be done with CloudFront/S3. SAM CLI by default looks for a
``./public/`` directory in your SAM project directory and will serve up
all files from it at the root of the HTTP server when using
``sam local start-api``. You can override the default static asset
directory by using the ``-s`` or ``--static-dir`` command line flag. You
can also disable this behaviour completely by setting
``--static-dir ""``.

Local Logging
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Both ``invoke`` and ``start-api`` command allow you to pipe logs from
the function’s invocation into a file. This will be useful if you are
running automated tests against SAM CLI and want to capture logs for
analysis.

Example:

.. code:: bash

   $ sam local invoke --log-file ./output.log

Remote Docker
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sam CLI loads function code by mounting filesystem to a Docker Volume.
As a result, The project directory must be pre-mounted on the remote
host where the Docker is running.

If mounted, you can use the remote docker normally using
``--docker-volume-basedir`` or environment variable
``SAM_DOCKER_VOLUME_BASEDIR``.

Example - Docker Toolbox (Windows):

When you install and run Docker Toolbox, the Linux VM with Docker is
automatically installed in the virtual box.

The /c/ path for this Linux VM is automatically shared with C: on the
host machine.

.. code:: powershell

   $ sam local invoke --docker-volume-basedir /c/Users/shlee322/projects/test "Ratings"

Advanced installations
----------------------

Build From Source
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, install Python(2.7 or 3.6) on your machine, then run the following:

.. code:: bash

   # Clone the repository
   $ git clone git@github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli.git

   # cd into the git
   $ cd aws-sam-cli

   # pip install the repository
   $ pip install --user -e .

Install with PyEnv
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
.. code:: bash

    # Install PyEnv (https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation)
    $ brew update
    $ brew install pyenv

    # Initialize pyenv using bash_profile
    $ echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi\nexport PATH="~/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
    # or using zshrc
    $ echo -e 'if command -v pyenv 1>/dev/null 2>&1; then\n  eval "$(pyenv init -)"\nfi\nexport PATH="~/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

    # restart the shell
    $ exec "$SHELL"

    # Install Python 2.7
    $ pyenv install 2.7.14
    $ pyenv local 2.7.14

    # Install the CLI
    $ pip install --user aws-sam-cli

    # Verify your installation worked
    $ sam –version

Troubleshooting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Mac Issues
^^^^^^^^^^

1. **TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION**:

If you get an error something similar to:

::

   Could not fetch URL https://pypi.python.org/simple/click/: There was a problem confirming the ssl certificate: [SSL: TLSV1_ALERT_PROTOCOL_VERSION] tlsv1 alert protocol version (_ssl.c:590) - skipping

then you are probably using the default version of Python that came with
your Mac. This is outdated. So make sure you install Python again using
homebrew and try again:

.. code:: bash

   $ brew install python

Once installed then repeat the `Installation process <#windows-linux-macos-with-pip>`_
