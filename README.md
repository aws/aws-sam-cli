The AWS Serverless Application Model (SAM) CLI is an open-source CLI tool that helps you develop serverless applications containing [Lambda functions](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Step Functions](https://aws.amazon.com/step-functions/), [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/), [EventBridge](https://aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/), [SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/), [SNS](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) and more. Some of the features it provides are:
- **Initialize serverless applications** in minutes with AWS provided infrastructure templates with `sam init`
- **Compile, build, and package** Lambda functions with provided runtimes and with custom Makefile workflows, for zip and image types of Lambda functions with `sam build`
- **Locally test** a Lambda function and API Gateway easily in a Docker container with `sam local` commands on SAM and CDK applications
- **Sync and test your changes in the cloud** with `sam sync` in your developer environments
- **Deploy** your SAM and CloudFormation templates using `sam deploy`
- Quickly **create pipelines** with prebuilt templates with popular CI/CD systems using `sam pipeline init`
- **Tail CloudWatch logs and X-Ray traces** with `sam log` and `sam trace`


## Get Started

To get started with building SAM-based applications, use the SAM CLI. SAM CLI provides a Lambda-like execution 
environment that lets you locally build, test, debug, and deploy [AWS serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/) applications.

* [Build & Deploy a "Hello World" Web App](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html)
* [Install AWS Toolkit](https://aws.amazon.com/getting-started/tools-sdks/#IDE_and_IDE_Toolkits) to use SAM with your favorite IDEs
* [Tutorials and Workshops](https://serverlessland.com/learn)
* [Lambda Powertools](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/simplifying-serverless-best-practices-with-lambda-powertools/) Utilities for building Lambda functions in [Python](https://awslabs.github.io/aws-lambda-powertools-python/latest/), [Java](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-java), and [TypeScript](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-lambda-powertools-typescript)

## What is this Github repository? üíª
This Github Repository contains source code for SAM CLI. Here is the development team talking about this code:

> SAM CLI code is written in Python. Source code is well documented, very modular, with 95% unit test coverage. 
It uses this awesome Python library called Click to manage the command line interaction and uses Docker to run Lambda functions locally.
We think you'll like the code base. Clone it and run `make pr` or `./Make -pr` on Windows!
