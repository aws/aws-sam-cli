    A class for project generation based on cookiecutter template

    Attributes
    ----------
    location: str
        Template location (git, mercurial, http(s), path)
    interactive_flows: Optional[List[InteractiveFlow]]
        An optional series of interactive questions to be asked to the user where the answers are used to fulfill
        the values of the cookiecutter.json keys, i.e. the cookiecutter context
    preprocessors: Optional[List[Processor]]
        An optional series of processes to be executed before generating the cookiecutter project. These processes
        are usually used to manipulate the cookiecutter context or doing some bootstrapping before generating
        the cookiecutter project.
        preprocessors are different than cookiecutter's hooks in the sense that they can mutate the context while
        the pre_gen_project hooks can't.
    postprocessors: Optional[List[Processor]]
        An optional series of processes to be executed after generating the cookiecutter project. These processes
        are usually used to clean up resources and to print messages to the user after successfully generating
        the cookiecutter project.
    plugins: Optional[List[Plugin]]
        An optional series of plugins to be plugged in. A plugin defines its own interactive_flow, preprocessor
        and postprocessor. A plugin is a sub-set of the template, if there is a common behavior among multiple
        templates, it is better to be extracted to a plugin that can then be plugged in to each of these templates.

    Methods
    -------
    run_interactive_flows() -> Dict:
        runs the interactive_flows(questions) one be one then combines and returns the answers in one dictionary
        in the form of {question.key: answer}
    generate_project(context) -> None:
        runs the preprocessors chain passing in the given context to the first processor which process it then produce
        a new context which is passed to the next preprocessor and so on.
        After that, it execute the cookiecutter generator to generate the project with the final preprocessed context.
        Finally, it runs the postprocessors chain with the same manner like the preprocessors.
