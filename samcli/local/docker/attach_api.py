    """

    Implements a method that wraps Docker Attach API to attach to a container and demux stdout and stderr data from the
    single data stream that Docker API returns.

    The signature of this method is intentionally similar to Docker Python SDK's ``attach()`` method except for the
    addition of one parameter called `demux` which, if set to True, will return an iterator that provides the stream
    data along with a stream type identifier. Caller can handle the data appropriately.

    Parameters
    ----------
    docker_client : docker.Client
        Docker client used to talk to Docker daemon

    container : docker.container
        Instance of the container to attach to

    stdout : bool
        Do you want to get stdout data?

    stderr : bool
        Do you want to get stderr data?

    logs : bool
        Do you want to include the container's previous output?

def _read_socket(socket):
    """
    The stdout and stderr data from the container multiplexed into one stream of response from the Docker API.
    It follows the protocol described here https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.30/#operation/ContainerAttach.
    The stream starts with a 8 byte header that contains the frame type and also payload size. Follwing that is the
    actual payload of given size. Once you read off this payload, we are ready to read the next header.

    This method will follow this protocol to read payload from the stream and return an iterator that returns
    a tuple containing the frame type and frame data. Callers can handle the data appropriately based on the frame
    type.

    ----------
