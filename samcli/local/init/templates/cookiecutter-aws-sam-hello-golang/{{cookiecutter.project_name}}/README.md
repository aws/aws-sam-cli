# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

This is a sample template for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} - Below is a brief explanation of what we have generated for you:

```bash
.
├── Makefile                    <-- Make to automate build
├── event.json                  <-- API Gateway Proxy Integration event payload
├── README.md                   <-- This instructions file
├── hello-world                 <-- Source code for a lambda function
│   ├── main.go                 <-- Lambda function code
│   └── main_test.go            <-- Unit tests
└── template.yaml
```

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies

In this example we use the built-in `go get` and the only dependency we need is AWS Lambda Go SDK:

```shell
go get -u github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/...
```

### Local development

**Building an executable target for Lambda runtime**

```shell
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hello-world/hello-world ./hello-world
```

**Invoking function locally using a local sample payload**

```bash
sam local invoke HelloWorldFunction --event event.json
```

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`

**SAM CLI** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    HelloWorld:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-template.html#serverless-sam-template-api
        Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda Python runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    FirstFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: hello-world/
            ...
```

First and foremost, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-quick-start.html) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs[?OutputKey==`HelloWorldApi`]' \
    --output table
``` 

## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called sam logs. sam logs lets you fetch logs generated by your Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

### Testing

We use `testing` package that is built-in in Golang and you can simply run the following command to run our tests:

```shell
go test -v ./hello-world/
```

## Cleanup

In order to delete our Serverless Application recently deployed you can use the following AWS CLI Command:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }}
```

# Appendix

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few things you can try to get more acquainted with building serverless applications using SAM:

### Create an additional API resource

* Create a catch all resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update tests

### Step-through debugging

* **[Enable step-through debugging docs for supported runtimes]((https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-using-debugging.html))**

Next, you can use AWS Serverless Application Repository to deploy ready to use Apps that go beyond hello world samples and learn how authors developed their applications: [AWS Serverless Application Repository main page](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
