# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

This is a sample template for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }} - Below is a brief explanation of what we have generated for you:

```bash

├── README.md                   <-- This instructions file

```

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [Golang](https://golang.org)

## Setup process

### Installing dependencies

In this example we use the built-in `go get` and the only dependency we need is AWS Lambda Go SDK:

```shell
go get -u github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/...
```

**NOTE:** As you change your application code as well as dependencies during development, you might want to research how to handle dependencies in Golang at scale.

### Building

Golang is a statically compiled language, meaning that in order to run it you have to build the executable target.

You can issue the following command in a shell to build it:

```shell
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o hello-world/hello-world ./hello-world
```

**NOTE**: If you're not building the function on a Linux machine, you will need to specify the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables, this allows Golang to build your function for another system architecture and ensure compatibility.

### Local development

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

If the previous command ran successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`

**SAM CLI** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    HelloWorld:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
        Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda Python runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    FirstFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: hello_world/
            ...
```

First and foremost, we need a `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
``` 

### Testing

We use `testing` package that is built-in in Golang and you can simply run the following command to run our tests:

```shell
go test -v ./hello-world/
```
# Appendix

### Golang installation

Please ensure Go 1.x (where 'x' is the latest version) is installed as per the instructions on the official golang website: https://golang.org/doc/install

A quickstart way would be to use Homebrew, chocolatey or your linux package manager.

#### Homebrew (Mac)

Issue the following command from the terminal:

```shell
brew install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
brew update
brew upgrade golang
```

#### Chocolatey (Windows)

Issue the following command from the powershell:

```shell
choco install golang
```

If it's already installed, run the following command to ensure it's the latest version:

```shell
choco upgrade golang
```
## AWS CLI commands

AWS CLI commands to package, deploy and describe outputs defined within the cloudformation stack:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameter-overrides MyParameterSample=MySampleValue

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few ideas that you can use to get more acquainted as to how this overall process works:

* Create an additional API resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update unit test to capture that
* Package & Deploy

Next, you can use the following resources to know more about beyond hello world samples and how others structure their Serverless applications:

* [AWS Serverless Application Repository](https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/serverlessrepo/)
