# Cookiecutter SAM for Node Lambda functions

This is a [Cookiecutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template to create a Serverless Hello World App based on Serverless Application Model (SAM) and NodeJS.

It is important to note that you should not try to `git clone` this project but use `cookiecutter` CLI instead as ``{{cookiecutter.project_name}}`` will be rendered based on your input and therefore all variables and files will be rendered properly.

## Requirements

Install `cookiecutter` command line: 

**Pip users**:

* `pip install cookiecutter`

**Homebrew users**:

* `brew install cookiecutter`

**Windows or Pipenv users**:

* `pipenv install cookiecutter`

**NOTE**: [`Pipenv`](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) is the new and recommended Python packaging tool that works across multiple platforms and makes Windows a first-class citizen.

## Usage

Generate a new SAM based Serverless App: `cookiecutter gh:aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-hello-nodejs`. 

You'll be prompted a few questions to help this cookiecutter template to scaffold this project and after its completed you should see a new folder at your current path with the name of the project you gave as input.

**NOTE**: After you understand how cookiecutter works (cookiecutter.json, mainly), you can fork this repo and apply your own mechanisms to accelerate your development process and this can be followed for any programming language and OS.
