# {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

This is a sample template for {{ cookiecutter.project_name }}

## Requirements

* AWS CLI already configured with Administrator permission
* [Docker installed](https://www.docker.com/community-edition)
* [SAM CLI installed](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-cli)
* [.NET Core installed](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download)

Please see the [currently supported patch of each major version of .NET Core](https://github.com/aws/aws-lambda-dotnet#version-status) to ensure your functions are compatible with the AWS Lambda runtime.

## Recommended Tools for Visual Studio / Visual Studio Code Users

* [AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio](https://aws.amazon.com/visualstudio/)
* [AWS Extensions for .NET CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli) which are AWS extensions to the .NET CLI focused on building .NET Core and ASP.NET Core applications and deploying them to AWS services including Amazon Elastic Container Service, AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS Lambda.

> **Note: this project uses [Cake Build](https://cakebuild.net/) for build, test and packaging requirements. You do not need to have the [AWS Extensions for .NET CLI](https://github.com/aws/aws-extensions-for-dotnet-cli) installed, but are free to do so if you which to use them. Version 3 of the Amazon.Lambda.Tools does require .NET Core 2.1 for installation, but can be used to deploy older versions of .NET Core.**

## Setup process

### Linux & macOS

```bash
sh build.sh --target=Package
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
build.ps1 --target=Package
```

### Local development

**Invoking function locally through local API Gateway**

```bash
sam local start-api
```

**SAM Local** is used to emulate both Lambda and API Gateway locally and uses our `template.yaml` to understand how to bootstrap this environment (runtime, where the source code is, etc.) - The following excerpt is what the CLI will read in order to initialize an API and its routes:

```yaml
...
Events:
    HelloWorldFunction:
        Type: Api # More info about API Event Source: https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/versions/2016-10-31.md#api
        Properties:
            Path: /hello
            Method: get
```

If the previous command run successfully you should now be able to hit the following local endpoint to invoke your function `http://localhost:3000/hello`

## Packaging and deployment

AWS Lambda C# runtime requires a flat folder with all dependencies including the application. SAM will use `CodeUri` property to know where to look up for both application and dependencies:

```yaml
...
    HelloWorldFunction:
        Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
        Properties:
            CodeUri: artifacts/HelloWorld.zip            
            ...
```

First and foremost, we need an `S3 bucket` where we can upload our Lambda functions packaged as ZIP before we deploy anything - If you don't have a S3 bucket to store code artifacts then this is a good time to create one:

```bash
aws s3 mb s3://BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, run the following command to package our Lambda function to S3:

```bash
sam package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME
```

Next, the following command will create a Cloudformation Stack and deploy your SAM resources.

```bash
sam deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM
```

> **See [Serverless Application Model (SAM) HOWTO Guide](https://github.com/awslabs/serverless-application-model/blob/master/HOWTO.md) for more details in how to get started.**

After deployment is complete you can run the following command to retrieve the API Gateway Endpoint URL:

```bash
aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Testing

For testing our code, we use XUnit and you can use `dotnet test` to run tests defined under `test/`

```bash
dotnet test test/HelloWorld.Test
```

Alternatively, you can use Cake. It discovers and executes all the tests.

### Linux & macOS

```bash
sh build.sh --target=Test
```

### Windows (Powershell)

```powershell
build.ps1 --target=Test
```

# Appendix

## AWS CLI commands

AWS CLI commands to package, deploy and describe outputs defined within the AWS CloudFormation stack:

```bash
aws cloudformation package \
    --template-file template.yaml \
    --output-template-file packaged.yaml \
    --s3-bucket REPLACE_THIS_WITH_YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME

aws cloudformation deploy \
    --template-file packaged.yaml \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} \
    --capabilities CAPABILITY_IAM \
    --parameter-overrides MyParameterSample=MySampleValue

aws cloudformation describe-stacks \
    --stack-name {{ cookiecutter.project_name.lower().replace(' ', '-') }} --query 'Stacks[].Outputs'
```

## Next Steps

Create your own .NET Core solution template to use with SAM CLI. [Cookiecutter for AWS SAM and .NET](https://github.com/aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-dotnet) provides you with a sample implementation how to use cookiecutter templating library to standardise how you initialise your Serverless projects.

``` bash
 sam init --location gh:aws-samples/cookiecutter-aws-sam-dotnet
```

For more information and examples of how to use `sam init` run 

``` bash
sam init --help
```

## Bringing to the next level

Here are a few ideas that you can use to get more acquainted as to how this overall process works:

* Create an additional API resource (e.g. /hello/{proxy+}) and return the name requested through this new path
* Update unit test to capture that
* Package & Deploy

Next, you can use the following resources to know more about beyond hello world samples and how others structure their Serverless applications:
